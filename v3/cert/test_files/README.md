# certmgr/cert test files

The test files in this directory are used to test functions in the "cert" package. Specifically, they're used in `cert_test.go`. 

These test files just contain certificates from Digicert and Google in order to do some basic certificate-equality tests in `cert_test.go`. If you plan to write more tests for the "cert" package, feel free to add your own (updated) certificates for testing.
